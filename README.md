# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bug: Class Name Conflicts and Unexpected Styling

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in Tailwind CSS: unexpected styling behaviors arising from class name conflicts or incorrect application. The bug is explained below.

## Bug Description:

The issue involves styling discrepancies where Tailwind CSS classes fail to produce the expected results.  This might manifest as:

* Classes not applying at all.
* Unexpected styles overriding intended styles.
* Inconsistent styling across different components or parts of the application.

This often stems from:

* Typos in class names.
* Conflicting class names from different libraries or custom CSS.
* Incorrect order of classes.
* Issues with the build process (e.g., incorrect webpack configuration).
* Problems with the Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js).

## Bug Reproduction:

The `bug.js` file demonstrates a simplified scenario where a component uses a Tailwind class. Even in this scenario, there's potential for bugs, especially with more complex projects.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected approach, including fixes for potential issues and best practices to avoid similar problems.

## How to run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the app using `npm start`. 

The solution demonstrates how to meticulously examine class names for conflicts and ensure correct usage of Tailwind classes to produce the expected visual output.
